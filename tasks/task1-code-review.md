# Task 1: Code Review and Improvement

## Background
The Marketing Data Service is responsible for aggregating campaign performance data from multiple marketing platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.) and making it available for analytics. The current implementation has several issues that could affect reliability, scalability, and maintenance.

## Task
1. Review the code in `src/services/marketingDataService.py`
2. Identify at least 5-7 critical issues with the current implementation
3. Implement fixes for the 3 most critical issues
4. Explain your prioritization decisions

## Instructions
1. Start by documenting all the issues you find in a comment at the top of the file
2. Implement your fixes directly in the file
3. Add comments explaining your changes and reasoning
4. Be prepared to explain which issues you chose not to fix immediately and why
5. Consider: What would you ask the team to address in follow-up work?

## Time
You should spend approximately 40 minutes on this task.

## Categories of Issues to Consider
- **Concurrency & Race Conditions:** How does the code handle concurrent requests?
- **Error Handling:** What happens when external APIs fail? Are errors properly logged?
- **Data Quality:** How does the service ensure data integrity and validation?
- **Performance & Scalability:** Will this work at scale? Are there N+1 query issues?
- **Security:** How are credentials handled? Is there input sanitization?
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Can you debug issues in production?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code maintainable? Are there code smells?

## Context for Prioritization
- This service processes data for 50+ active clients
- It runs every hour to sync campaign data
- Failures can cause dashboards to show stale data
- The team consists of 5 engineers (2 data engineers, 1 data scientist, 2 full-stack developers)
- You have 2 weeks until a major client demo

## What We're Looking For
- **Leadership thinking:** How do you prioritize technical debt vs. new features?
- **Architectural judgment:** Can you identify systemic issues vs. superficial problems?
- **Pragmatic solutions:** Balance between perfect and good enough
- **Communication:** Can you explain technical issues to non-technical stakeholders?

Remember, as VP Engineering, you're not just fixing code - you're setting standards for the team and making strategic technical decisions.
