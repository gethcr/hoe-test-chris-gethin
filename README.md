# Ask Bosco VP Engineering Assessment

Welcome to the Ask Bosco VP Engineering technical assessment. This assessment is designed to evaluate your leadership abilities, architectural thinking, system design approach, and hands-on technical skills within the context of a marketing analytics platform.

## Overview

Ask Bosco is building an AI-powered marketing analytics platform that ingests data from 100+ sources (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, GA4, Shopify, etc.), combines them with AI for better analytics, and delivers actionable insights to marketing agencies and eCommerce retailers.

The platform is built on Python and hosted on Google Cloud, using modern data stack tools for ingestion, transformation, and analytics.

## Assessment Structure

This assessment consists of four tasks, each designed to evaluate different aspects of the VP Engineering role:

1. **Code Review and Improvement** (40 minutes)
   - Review and improve a Python service with several architectural issues
   - See `tasks/task1-code-review.md` for details

2. **System Design** (20 minutes)
   - Design a scalable marketing analytics platform architecture
   - See `tasks/task2-system-design.md` for details

3. **Engineering Leadership** (20 minutes)
   - Create a prioritized plan for a team with competing priorities
   - See `tasks/task3-leadership.md` for details

4. **Practical Coding** (40 minutes)
   - Implement a data validation API endpoint
   - See `tasks/task4-coding.md` for details

## Instructions

1. This assessment is designed to take approximately 2-3 hours to complete, including discussions and debrief.
2. You may use online resources, but all work must be your own
3. For the system design task, you can create diagrams using any tool you prefer (draw.io, Excalidraw, hand-drawn, etc.)
4. All code is designed to run locally - no cloud setup required
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Run tests: `pytest src/tests/`
7. Quality is more important than quantity - it's better to solve fewer tasks well than all tasks poorly

## Evaluation Criteria

We will evaluate your submission based on:

1. **Leadership & Communication** (30%)
   - Prioritization clarity and justification
   - Communication style and clarity
   - Delegation and stakeholder management approach
   - Process improvement thinking

2. **System Design & Architecture** (25%)
   - Scalable architectural decisions
   - Understanding of trade-offs
   - Incremental rollout strategy
   - Cloud-native thinking (tool-agnostic)

3. **Technical Judgment** (20%)
   - Ability to identify and prioritize critical issues in code
   - Root cause analysis vs. symptom fixing
   - Pragmatic vs. perfect solutions
   - Security and performance awareness

4. **Team & Culture** (15%)
   - Mentorship approach
   - Team development thinking
   - Cross-functional team management
   - Building high-performing cultures

5. **Execution** (10%)
   - Practical coding ability
   - Testing mindset
   - Code quality and maintainability
   - Attention to critical details

## Business Context

- **Markets:** Marketing & eCommerce Agencies, eCommerce retailers
- **Team Structure:** 2 data engineers, 1 data scientist, 2 full-stack developers
- **Scale:** 100+ data sources, thousands of clients, billions of rows of data
- **Key Challenges:** Data quality, pipeline performance, cost optimization, rapid feature delivery
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Google Cloud Platform, modern data engineering tools

## Philosophy of This Assessment

This assessment focuses on **leadership competencies and architectural thinking**, not tool-specific expertise. We assume:
- ✅ Python experience
- ✅ General data engineering patterns
- ✅ Cloud architecture principles (tool-agnostic)
- ❌ No specific DBT, ThoughtSpot, or Airbyte knowledge required
- ❌ Not a senior backend developer role - leadership matters most

## Submission

Please complete as many of the tasks as you can within the allotted time. If you cannot complete all tasks, prioritize based on what you believe would provide the most value and demonstrate your strengths as a VP Engineering candidate.

Good luck! We're excited to see your approach to these challenges.
